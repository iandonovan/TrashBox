# TrashBox

## Introduction
The project mainly focuses on nonlinear distortion of sound fed to the iPad through line-in. This audio will be processed in real time and modified by the user through simple drawing actions.

Initially, a simple line is displayed to the user; this represents the Voltage Out / Voltage In curve, and it starts off linear. The user will be able to bend and warp this curve as he sees fit; this will distort the sound. The app is called "TrashBox" because much of what the user creates can sound very grimy. Nonlinear distortion is an interesting sound, but it's not one that we commonly hear in pop music.
